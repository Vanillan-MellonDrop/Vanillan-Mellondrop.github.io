  <h1>Why Do I Code?</h1>
  <div class="why">
    <p>When I was growing up, kids didn't really have electronics like they
      do today. The coolest thing a kid could have was a TV in their bedroom.
      As most kids in the 90s, I relied on my imagination as my main source of
      entertainment. We could be anyone, or anything, and as video games became a
      a teenage staple, I began to want more out of my gaming experiences.</p>
    <p>I wanted to have the same levels of customization as my my imagination did
      back then. I wanted to see strong female protagonists, kicking butt and taking
      names, just as good as anyone else. I almost lost my love of video games
      because of the sincere lack of strong female protagonists and nearly customized
      story archs...almost...</p>
    <p>After long hours spent searching for something I could deem playable I
      stumbled upon the website of an independent video game developer who came very
      close to what I was looking for. One site after another, more and more
      independent video game developers had websites popping up left and right! However,
      none of them had exactly what I was looking for. As I got older, I came to a
      very sudden conclusion. If no one was making what I was looking for, I'd learn
      how to code it myself.</p>
    <p>Learning how to code is as hard as learning a language, yet it can be as
      beautiful as one of Michelangelo's works of art. I enjoy the output that
      hours stuck behind a desk gives me. I'm enthralled with the amount of nearly
      limitless possibilities! I love how it makes me feel like I can develop anyone,
      or anything, I could dream up. I strive to one day make video games with
      strong female protagonists that have powerful and dynamic story archs with
      branching storylines that will allow players to feel capable of playing for
      hours! I want to create both quality video games, and quality characters.</p>
