  <h1>My Work History</h1>
<p>Arby's was my first job. I did a little of everything there. I started when I
was 19, and stayed for 3 years. When I had to quit to care for my grandmother, I
was offered the position of shift manager if I would stay on. some of the
things I did included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Opening/Closing Precedures</li>
  <li>Customer Service</li>
  <li>Truck Precedures</li>
  <li>Detailed Cleaning</li>
  <li>Stocking Both Restrooms</li></ul>
<p>My second job was Rite Aid. I was there about 2 years,
  and some of my responsibilities were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Opening/Closing Precedures</li>
    <li>Customer Service</li>
    <li>Truck Precedures</li>
    <li>Detailed Cleaning</li>
    <li>Stocking Both Restrooms</li></ul>
<p>After working at Rite Aid, I took care of my grndmother until her passing. At
  that time, I took up a job at the post office. I worked in the distribution center
  for a little over a year, and many thought I'd become a manager one day. Some of my
  duties were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sorting Dead Letters</li>
    <li>Running Mail On A Conveyor Belt</li>
    <li>Sorting Packages</li>
    <li>Tying Off Full Mail Sacks</li>
    <li>Scanning Barcodes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>My third job was working at Cracker Barrel, and I was there for the better part
    of a year. I took care of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Opening/Closing Precedures</li>
      <li>Customer Service</li>
      <li>Truck Precedures</li>
      <li>Detailed Cleaning</li>
      <li>Stocking Both Restrooms</li></ul>
  <p>Finally, my current  job has me swapping out being a lirary clerk during the school
    semester for being on the cleaning crew in the summer. Depending on the time of year,
    I'm a library desk clerk, or a housekeeper for Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology.
    I've managed to successfully split my time:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Processing New Books</li>
      <li>Returned Books And DVDs To The Shelves</li>
      <li>Checking Out Library Materials To Students</li>
      <li>Getting The Mail</li>
      <li>Set Up New Displays</li>
      <li>Moving Furniture</li>
      <li>Detailed Cleaning</li>
      <li>Catologuing Items Left Behind</li>
      <li>Wiping Down Every Surface</li>
      <li>Using A Buffer</li>
    </ul>
